# Tests for lib/forge.sh — detect_forge_provider (issue #57) and
# detect_forge_host (issue #62)
#
# Behavioral contract (from the issue):
#   detect_forge_provider <remote_url>
#     prints exactly one of: gh | glab | tea | fj | unknown
#   Detection rules:
#     host == github.com         -> gh
#     host == codeberg.org       -> fj
#     host matches *gitlab*      -> glab (self-hosted, case-insensitive)
#     host matches *gitea*       -> tea  (case-insensitive)
#     anything else / malformed  -> unknown
#   URL forms supported:
#     https://[user@]host[:port]/owner/repo[.git]
#     git@host:owner/repo[.git]                        (scp-like)
#     ssh://[user@]host[:port]/owner/repo[.git]
#   Exit code is always 0 — callers parse stdout.
#
# Issue #62 adds detect_forge_host <remote_url> for fj --host binding:
#   - Codeberg remotes map to codeberg.org.
#   - SSH remotes map to the bare host.
#   - HTTPS self-hosted Forgejo remotes preserve scheme, port, and base path.
#   - Plain HTTP remotes produce no binding.
